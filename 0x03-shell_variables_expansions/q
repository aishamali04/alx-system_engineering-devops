       The _a_l_i_a_s utility shall create or redefine alias definitions or write the values of
       existing alias definitions to standard  output.  An  alias  definition  provides  a
       string  value that shall replace a command name when it is encountered; see _S_e_c_t_i_o_n
       _2_._3_._1, _A_l_i_a_s _S_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n.

       An alias definition shall affect the current shell execution  environment  and  the
       execution  environments  of the subshells of the current shell. When used as speci‐
       fied by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, the alias definition shall not affect the par‐
       ent  process of the current shell nor any utility environment invoked by the shell;
       see _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._1_2, _S_h_e_l_l _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.

       If no operands are given, all alias definitions shall be written to  standard  out‐
       put.

       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of _a_l_i_a_s:

       _L_A_N_G      Provide  a  default value for the internationalization variables that are
                 unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008,  _S_e_c_t_i_o_n
                 _8_._2,  _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s for the precedence of international‐
                 ization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       _L_C___A_L_L    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other
                 internationalization variables.

       _L_C___C_T_Y_P_E  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text
                 data as characters (for example, single-byte  as  opposed  to  multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S
                 Determine  the  locale  that should be used to affect the format and con‐
                 tents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       _N_L_S_P_A_T_H   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of  _L_C___M_E_S_‐
                 _S_A_G_E_S.

       The format for displaying aliases (when no operands or only _n_a_m_e operands are spec‐

       The _v_a_l_u_e string shall be written with appropriate quoting so that it  is  suitable
       for  reinput  to  the  shell.  See the description of shell quoting in _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._2,

        2. Create a simple ``redo'' command to repeat previous entries in the command his‐

        4. Set up _n_o_h_u_p so that it can deal with an argument that is itself an alias name:

RRAATTIIOONNAALLEE
       The _a_l_i_a_s description is based on historical KornShell implementations. Known  dif‐
       ferences  exist  between that and the C shell. The KornShell version was adopted to
       be consistent with all the other KornShell features in this volume of POSIX.1‐2008,
       such as command line editing.

       Since  _a_l_i_a_s  affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally pro‐
       vided as a shell regular built-in.

       Historical versions of the KornShell have allowed aliases to be exported to scripts
       that  are  invoked by the same shell. This is triggered by the _a_l_i_a_s −−xx flag; it is
       allowed by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 only when an explicit extension such  as  −−xx
       is  used.  The standard developers considered that aliases were of use primarily to
       interactive users and that they should normally not affect shell scripts called  by
       those users; functions are available to such scripts.

       Historical  versions  of  the  KornShell had not written aliases in a quoted manner
       suitable for reentry to the shell, but this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 has made this  a
       requirement for all similar output. Therefore, consistency was chosen over this de‐
       tail of historical practice.
